T20 WORLD CUP CRICKET DATA ANALYTICS -CRICKET ANALYSIS [PYTHON | WEB SCRAPPING |PANDAS | POWER BI]

Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11
players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data
from ESPN Cricinfo with a Brightdata website
tool, cleaning and transforming the data with
pandas, and evaluating various player
performance metrics.

Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select
players for various categories (openers, middle
order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist
fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11
players to play in the match.
